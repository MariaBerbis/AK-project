        <h3>Why is Alicia Keys the best?</h3>
        <p>
          Itâ€™s unusual for an artist to be so multi-talented. Beyonce is a globally famous, acclaimed vocalist while
          also
          being an
          incredible dancer, actress and performer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her concerts are well-known for their incredible spectacle - the sets,
          the
          choreography - and she sells out stadiums and arenas internationally. She has performed at presidential
          inaugurations
          and the Super Bowl. Beyonce has been at the peak of the music world for over 20 years and has always
          successfully
          reinvented herself, encompassing so many different genres like R&B, hip-hop, rock, country and blues.
        </p>
        <p>She has sold over 200 million records and is the most-awarded female artist of all time. You can call her
          Queen
          Bey!</p>
