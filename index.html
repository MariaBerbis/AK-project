          <h2>Why Alicia Keys</h2>
          <h3>Why is Alicia Keys the best?</h3>
          <p>
            It's unusual for an artist to be so multi-talented. Alicia Keys is a classically trained pianist and started
            composing when she was 12 and signed at 15 years old by Columbia Records.
          </p>
          <p>
            Her debut album, Songs in A Minor, sold over 12 million copies worldwide and earned Keys 5 Grammy Awards in
            2002. <em>Best
              New Artist</em> and <em>Song of the Year</em> for "Fallin" are a few of her accolades. She is also the
            second
            American artist
            ever to receive five Grammys in a single night.

            All of her albums except for her fourth, The Element of Freedom, peaked at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 in the
            US.</p>
          <p>Alicia Keys is a 15-time Grammy winner and has sold over 90 million records worldwide.</p>
