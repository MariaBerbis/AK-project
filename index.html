          <h3>Why is Alicia Keys the best?</h3>
          <p>
            It's unusual for an artist to be so multi-talented. Alicia Keys is a classically trained pianist and started
            composing when she was 12 and signed at 15 years old by Columbia Records.
          </p>
          <p>
            Her debut album, Songs in A Minor, sold over 12 million copies worldwide and earned Keys 5 Grammy Awards in
            2002. <em>Best
              New Artist</em> and <em>Song of the Year</em> for "Fallin" are a few of her accolades. She is also the
            second
            American artist
            ever to receive five Grammys in a single night.

            All of her albums except for her fourth, The Element of Freedom, peaked at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 in the
            US.</p>
          <p>Alicia Keys is a 15-time Grammy winner and has sold over 90 million records worldwide.</p>

              <h4>If I ain't got you</h4>
              <p>A song recorded by the artist herself for her second studio album <em>The Diary of Alicia Keys</em>
                (2003).
                Inspired by the 2001 death of singer Aaliyah, the September 11 attacks, and other events in the world
                and
                in Keys' life,
                the song is about "how material things don't feed the soul".</p>

              <p>"Some people live for the fortune <br />
                Some people live just for the fame<br />
                Some people live for the power, yeah<br />
                Some people live just to play the game <br>
                Some people think <br>
                That the physical things <br>
                Define what's within <br>
                And I've been there before <br>
                That life's a bore <br>
                So full of the superficial <br>
                Some people want it all <br>
                But I don't want nothing at all <br>
                If it ain't you, baby <br>
                If I ain't got you, baby…"</p>

              <p>It was written by Keys, Kanye West and Harold Lilly, and produced by Keys and West. The song contains a
                sample from the
                1975 song "Let Me Prove My Love to You" of The Main Ingredient (J.R. Bayle). <br />In this music video,
                rapper Mos Def plays Michael Harris, Alicia's love interest, and Keys plays a waitress at a restaurant.
                One day, Keys meets this man in the café, and she falls in love with him. Later on, Keys is at a house
                party where she runs into that same man.</p>
