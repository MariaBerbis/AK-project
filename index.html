          <h3>Why is Alicia Keys the best?</h3>
          <p>
            It's unusual for an artist to be so multi-talented. Alicia Keys is a classically trained pianist and started
            composing when she was 12 and signed at 15 years old by Columbia Records.
          </p>
          <p>
            Her debut album, Songs in A Minor, sold over 12 million copies worldwide and earned Keys 5 Grammy Awards in
            2002. <em>Best
              New Artist</em> and <em>Song of the Year</em> for "Fallin" are a few of her accolades. She is also the
            second
            American artist
            ever to receive five Grammys in a single night.

            All of her albums except for her fourth, The Element of Freedom, peaked at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 in the
            US.</p>
          <p>Alicia Keys is a 15-time Grammy winner and has sold over 90 million records worldwide.</p>

            <p>A song recorded by the artist herself for her second studio album <em>The Diary of Alicia Keys</em>
              (2003).
              Inspired by the 2001 death of singer Aaliyah, the September 11 attacks, and other events in the world and
              in Keys' life,
              the song is about "how material things don't feed the soul".</p>

              Some people live for the power, yeah<br />
